# Confidence Histograms

This repository provides an efficient representation for assessment of model
calibration in machine learning / deep learning.

In particular, it allows to collect information about a segmentation model's
confidence in every pixel or voxel of a number of cases and then allows to
investigate model calibration per label or per case via a number of different
measures.

Details can be found in our paper:
